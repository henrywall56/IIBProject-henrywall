% FOCOMPENSATION [z] = FRecovery(y,Rs,FEstimate) %
% %
% This function performs frequency recovery in the signal 'y'. Using the %
% spectal analysis of the signal 'y' raised to 4-th power an estimate %
% 'Delta_f' of the carrier frequency offset is generated. Then, the %
% frequency recovery is performed as %
% z = y.*exp(-1i*k*2*pi*Delta_f*Ts) %
% where 'Ts' is the symbol period and 'k' is the temporal index of the %
% symbols; %
% %
% Input: %
% y = Signal in which the frequency recovery will be performed. %
% Signal 'y' must be obtained at 1 sample per symbol. For %
% transmission in single pol. orientation, 'y' must be a %
% column vector. For transmission with pol. multiplexing, %
% 'y' must be a matrix with two column-oriented vectors, %
% where each column vector corresponds to the signal of one %
% pol. orientation; %
% Rs = Symbol rate in symbols/second; %
% FEstimate = Flag to enable ('true') or disable ('false') the estimated%
% carrier frequency offset value as an output of the function;%
% %
% Output: %
% z = Signal produced after compensating for the frequency %
% offset present on 'y'; %
% varargout = Estimated carrier frequency offsert in Hz; %
